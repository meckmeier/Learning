From 1987, when E.O. Wilson described invertebrates as “the little things that run the world,” to 2018, when a New York Times Magazine cover declared “The Insect Apocalypse is Here,” insect populations declined precipitously.  Why are they disappearing and why does it matter?  We will look at findings by people who have been counting insects for decades, including observers in Germany’s protected areas, butterfly watchers in Ohio, and a scientist conducting research in Puerto Rico.  Much of their information has only recently been synthesized and published, and is now receiving widespread attention.  Other than the cheerless prospect of no butterflies, bumble bees, or fireflies, what are the consequences of insect declines?  Will human workers replace pollinating bees around the world, as they have in China’s orchards?  Closer to home, how can our own landscaping practices improve habitats and support insects?",,,,

The intent will be to explore and discuss the plants we find and their identifying features, with as much or as little instruction from the trip leader (and other knowledgeable people) as desired.
Access is easy, we will hop into the fen right off the highway. It is quite wet – if you wear rubber boots, be OK with the likelihood of topping your boot (I did when scouting – I will take the Chaco approach for the trip).
This fen, right off US-2, sits within the Ottawa National Forest boundary but is privately owned. Big thanks to the landowners who have granted us permission to explore their fen and enjoy the plants! Keep this in mind and be respectful.
Where to meet:
Along US-2, approximately 10 miles east of Marenisco, MI and 18 miles west of Watersmeet, MI
 

US-2 is being resurfaced, but when I visited June 7 this stretch was not yet under construction and parking was still available along the shoulder. If we cannot park along US-2 due to construction, then we will use the alternative space along Stage Coach. Or, if you are more comfortable parking off the highway, use the alternative spot and walk down to meet.
Preferred parking: On US-2, just east of Stage Coach Road, on the east-bound side near the ATV trail (46.35666, 89.50516).

The vernal or spring equinox marks the date the Sun passes directly over the celestial equator on its northward journey. It also marks the beginning of astronomical spring in the northern hemisphere.  Usually associated with 12 hours of day and night, the tilt of the Earth’s axis is pointed neither directly at nor away from the Sun. Celebrated across many cultures, this is a time for renewal and rebirth. It represents the continued lengthening of days and the return of light for growth among all life. 

Director of Education Tom Finley will guide us on a hike to explore the significance of the spring in Wisconsin. After the hike, we’ll enjoy time around a fire.  ",Schlitz Audubon Nature Center,"Thursday, March 20, 2025 | 10:00 am - 11:30 am"," Member: $17 | Non-Member: $23

Bats fly seemingly silent through the night sky. The science of bioacoustics has taught us otherwise. Beyond our limited hearing range, bats emit high frequency calls to locate prey. Through the combined power of science and technology, humans have learned to identify bat species by their ultrasonic calls.

Join Paul White and Caroline Frantz to learn more about bioacoustic monitoring and how it is being used in the conservation efforts of Wisconsin’s bat population.","Retzer Nature Center, Waukesha WI ","Wednesday, May 14, 2025 • 7-8:30 p.m.","COST: Free! (ages 12+)
